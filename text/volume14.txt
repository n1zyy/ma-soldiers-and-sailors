MASSACHUSETTS SOLDIERS AND SAILORS 

IN THE 

WAR OF THE REVOLUTION. 



NOTE. All names are given exactly as they appear on the original records. The order of 
arrangement of the facts of service in each individual record given is the same, as nearly as pos 
sible, as the original entries, and is as follows : The name; the place of residence, if given; the 
rank; the kind of document whereon the record appears; the enlistment and discharge, if 
given; the time of service; remarks. 

A discrepancy will sometimes be noted between the service given and the actual service as 
figured between the dates of enlistment and discharge. The difference is accounted for by the 
practice of including, with service performed, a time allowance for travel on the basis of one 
day for every 20 miles out or home. As the same name may appear under various forms, each 
carrying some portion of a record of service, it is necessary in order to obtain the complete 
record, as far as preserved, of any given individual, to examine all the forms under which 
a name is stated to appear in the Record Index.

when owing to depreciation of money their wages were insufficient, where 
upon they applied to Col. Chase, Deputy Quartermaster General, for 9 specie

SPRAGUE, WILLIAM. Letter from Samuel Dow to James Perkins, dated Boston,

had been employed as blacksmiths in the Quarter Master s department at 
Boston from early in 1776 to Jan. 1, 1778, when owing to depreciation of money 
their wages were insufficient, whereupon they applied to Col. Chase, Deputy 
Quartermaster General, for 9 specie per month, or its equivalent, as wages, 
but as they failed to receive any increased allowance, they applied to Gen. 
Heath, who promised to write to Gen. Pickering and secure the advance re 
quested; they remained continuously in service until Sept., 1780, their pay 
remaining unchanged until March 1, 1780, when they were allowed 9 per 
month in specie notes ; the claim for the extra allowance asked for was 
apparently not granted, as the foregoing letter was read in Continental Con 
gress and returned to said Dow without action, and two endorsements bearing 
dates Boston, Oct. 15, 1788, and Sept. 27, 1790, show that the grievance of the
