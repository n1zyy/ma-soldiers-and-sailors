MASSACHUSETTS SOLDIERS AND SAILORS 

IN THE 

WAR OF THE REVOLUTION. 



NOTE. All names are given exactly as they appear on the original records. The order of 
arrangement of the facts of service in each individual record given is the same, aa nearly as pos 
sible, as the original entries, and is as follows : The name ; the place of residence, if given ; the 
rank; the kind of document whereon the record appears; the enlistment and discharge, if 
given; the time of service; remarks. 

A discrepancy will sometimes be noted between the service given and the actual service as 
figured between the dates of enlistment and discharge. The difference is accounted for by the 
practice of including, with service performed, a time allowance for travel on the basis of one 
day for every 20 miles out or home. As the same name may appear under various forms, each 
carrying some portion of a record of service, it is necessary in order to obtain the complete 
record, as far as preserved, of any given individual, to examine all the forms under which 
a name is stated to appear in the Record Index.
