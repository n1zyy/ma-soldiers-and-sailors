PREFACE. 



The General Court of 1891, by chapter 100 of its resolves, 
directed the Secretary of the Commonwealth to prepare and 
publish " An indexed compilation of the records of the Mas- 
sachusetts soldiers and sailors who served in the army or 
navy during the Revolutionary War, as shown in the archives 
in the office of the Secretary." The work was begun in Sep- 
tember of 1891 by making a card record index to all names 
found upon the muster rolls, pay rolls and other documents 
which form the Revolutionary War archives. The Revolu- 
tionary collection at that time numbered sixty volumes of 
rolls, orders, receipts, etc., together with the continental 
regiment books, numbering twenty-one volumes of individual 
pay accounts. The work on this collection had been nearly 
completed when a mass of rolls and miscellaneous papers was 
purchased, under authority of chapter 33 of the Resolves of 
1893, from Mr. Samuel A. Drake. This addition is equiva- 
lent in amount of material to two volumes and is now known 
as the Drake collection. Subsequent to this extension of the 
Revolutionary series, in 1894, a large number of company and 
regimental returns, descriptive lists, orderly books, account 
books, etc., making fourteen new volumes, were found among 
a miscellaneous, unclassified collection of documents which 
had been hidden away for years in the various storage places 
connected with the Secretary's office. Although much more 
time had been occupied in preparing the work for printing 
than had been originally estimated, it was deemed proper to 
incorporate these newly found records in the regular work, 
rather than to add a supplement ; and this was accordingly 
done. It will be seen that the original Revolutionary rolls 



IV â–  PREFACE. 



collection has been augmented by sixteen volumes, and it is 
estimated that the number of references to individual records 
of service has been increased at least one-third. It is from 
the card record index, comprising over six hundred and 
twenty thousand cards, that copy has 1)een i)repared for the 
printer. In the mean time, the card record index itself has 
been in use to answer thousands of requests for certificates of 
service. 

The arrangement of records in the printed volumes is the 
same as that of the card record index. The alphabetical 
arrangement of the names forms in itself an index to the 
work, and the plan of placing against each name every entry 
of separate and distinct service that could be identified as be- 
lonjrinii: to it reduces the task of searchinof for the record of 
any given individual to a minimum. 

In crediting service to any given individual, no attempt has 
been made to force identification where a person of similar 
name has been found upon the rolls as serving at a distinct and 
separate interval of time, in a difterent command and without 
any place of residence stated. Many of the rolls furnish no 
proof whatever as to residence of the men l)orne upon them. 
In addition to this fact, the practice of repeating common 
family names in various branches of the same family, which 
was in vogue at the period of the Revolution, rendered it un- 
safe to group together records of service merely because of 
similarity of names. The principle was adopted of bringing 
together scattered records of service and crediting them to one 
individual where identification was proven l)y place of resi- 
dence, bycontinuous service, or ])y service in the same com- 
mand at not too widely separated intervals, when it might be 
fairly presumed that the proofs of continuous service had failed 
of preservation and were only lacking from the state's collec- 
tion. All records that failed to meet these tests are simply 
printed as they are found, and must stand as unidentified. 
Again, it may happen that records of service of a given indi- 



PREFACE. V 

vidua! are separated by reason of a difference in spelling, or 
by the use at different times of obsolete or distorted forms of 
the same name. In order to render accessible to the searcher 
such individual records as may be separated by this cause, 
reference is made ag'ainst the modern or approved form of a 
name to every variation from it to be found in the index, it 
being understood that in every case the names are printed ex- 
actly as found"upon the original documents. By this means, 
where a record credited to any given individual appears incom- 
plete, an examination of the various forms of the name will 
often result in supplying the missing information ; although it 
must be borne in mind that full and complete records of service 
are not to be looked for in all cases, as the documentary proof 
is lacking from the archives, either because it has disappeared 
through a lack of proper care in the preservation of such 
material in former years, or because it never found its way 
into the custody of the Secretary's office. This is notably 
the case with regard to the year 1776, there l)eing fewer rolls 
for service during that year than of any other during the 
period covered by the Kevolutionar}^ War. 

A discrepancy will sometimes be found between the time 
allowed for a term of service and the actual time shown by the 
dates of enlistment and discharge. This arises from the prac- 
tice then in vogue of including in the term of service per- 
formed, an allowance, in days, for the distance travelled be- 
tween the place of service and the respective homes of the 
men enlisted. This obtained in all militia service and every 
twenty miles of travel was reckoned as an additional day. 
Any difference that may be found, therefore, of the kind above 
noted, is explained by the custom of making such allowances 
and simply means that travel is included in the service credited. 

It is to be regretted that the records of naval service dur- 
ing the Revolution in the possession of the Commonwealth, 
should be so meagre and incomplete as compared with those 
of military service, inasmuch as history records that the ser- 



VI PREFACE. 

vice rendered by the men of Massachusetts afloat was equally 
as creditable and meritorious as that rendered by the laud 
forces. By far the greater part of such service was performed 
by ])rivateers, and, these being matter of private enterprise, 
no official returns of officers or crews were required. Save 
the records of commissions granted to commanders of pri- 
vateers, an occasional crew list sworn to on clearance before 
naval officers is all that is to be found among the state archives 
to furnish j)roof of privateer service. Such records of naval 
service as there are consist mainly of rolls of state armed 
vessels, as they were called, made up for pay due officers and 
men for service performed during each cruise or term of en- 
gagement. But even these records do not show continuous 
service of such vessels in commission and are fewer in number 
than might be expected. 

There are included among the records published some of 
men who served in various Rhode Island regiments and in 
the First New York Regiment, fifty rolls and lists of the 
former and about a dozen of the latter being comprised in the 
Massachusetts Revolutionary Rolls collection. It was thought 
best to embody them here, as it was exceedingly doubtful 
whether they would otherwise ever be put in print. 

The following summary of the legislation of the Province 
and Commonwealth during the Revolutionary War })eriod is 
by Mr. James J. Tracy, Chief of the Archives Division of this 
office, who has had immediate charge of the entire work of 
compilation. Acknowledgment is due here of the intelligent 
and painstaking manner in which he has performed liis duty.

Secretary of the Commonwealth. 



Revolutionary War Legislation 

OF THE 

Province and Commonwealth. 



In the First Provincial Congress, on the 26th of October, 
. 1774, a committee, appointed "to consider what is necessary 
to be done for the defence and safety of the Province &c," 
made a report, upon which a resolve was immediately passed, 
making provision for the appointment of a Committee of 
Safety, who were empowered and directed, ^'when ever they 
shall judge it Necessary for the safety and Defence of the 
Inhabitants of this province and their Property against such 
person or persons as aforesaid to alarm, muster, and cause to 
be assembled with the utmost expedition, and compleatly 
armed accourtied and supplied with provisions sufficient for 
their support in their march to the place of Rendezvous, such 
and so many of the ^Militia of this Province as they shall judge 
necessary for the ends aforesaid ". Provision was made for 
the pay and subsistence of the force so assembled, and for the 
appointment of general officers. It was also resolved that such 
companies of the existing militia as had not already chosen 
officers should do so forthwith, and where said officers should 
"Judge the limits of the present Regiments too extencive," 
they should divide them and adjust their limits and proceed 
to elect field officers to command the regiments so formed. 
The field officers so appointed were directed to endeavor " to 
enlist one quater at ye least of the Number of the respective 
Companies, and form them into Companies of Fifty privates 
at the least who shall Equip and hold themselves in Readi- 
ness on the shortest notice from the said Committee of Safety 
to March to the place of Rendezvous, and that each and every 
Company so formed Choose a Captain & two Lieutenants to 
Command them on any such Emergent and necessary Service 
as they may be called to by the Committee of Safety aforesaid 



X INTRODUCTION. 



tuul tluit the said Captain & Subalterns so elected form the 
said Companies into Battalions to consist of Nine Com})anies 
each, and that the Cai)tains & subalterns of each Battalion so 
formed proceed to Elect Field Officers to Command the same." 
It was also recommended that the inhabitants of the province 
provide themselves with arms and equipments "and perfect 
themselves in the ^Military skill/' and that, if any were not 
provided with arms and ammunition, according to law, or if 
any town or district were not provided with the full town 
stock of arms and ammunition, according to law, the select- 
men of such town or district were to take effectual care, with- 
out delay, to provide the same. This same resolve of the 
Provincial Congress [jrovided for the purchase by the Com- 
mittee of Safety of cannon, small arms, annuunition and ord- 
nance stores, to the value of Â£20,837, to be deposited in such 
secure places as the Committee of Safety should direct. 

Tlie minute-men were organized under this resolve, and it 
accounts for the promptness with Avhich they assembled in 
response to the alarm of the 19th of April, 1775. It is a 
notable fact that the rolls for that service are in better form 
and better prepared than any others in the possession of the 
Commonwealth. Of course but a small fraction of those 
credited with service at the time of the Lexington alarm took 
pait in the actual affair of that day, l)ut the minute-men who 
assembled and marclied to Cambridge and Roxbury on that 
alarm formed the nucleus of the first army organized, which 
later, under AVashinglon, laid siege to Boston. 

On the day following the passage of the resolve above men- 
tioned, the Committee of Safety and three general officers 
were appointed, Jedediah Preble, Artemas Ward and Seth 
Pomeroy 1)eing chosen as first, second and third in command 
respectively. 

Oct. 29, 1774, a resolve was passed that an extract from 
the resolves relative to the militia l)e })rinted and a copy 
thereof sent to every town and district in the province, and 
two additional members were appointed on the Committee of 
Safety. 

Under date of Dec. 8, 1774, John Thomas and AVilliam 
Heath were chosen as general officers in addition to those 
previously a])pointed. 



INTRODUCTION. XI 



Dec. 10, 1774, the committee on the state of the province 
reported to the Provincial Congress an address "To the 
Freeholders and other Inhal)itants of the Towns and Districts 
of Massachusetts Bay," which was accepted and ordered to be 
l)rinted in all the Boston newspapers and also in hand bills, 
and a copy thereof sent- to all the towns and districts in the 
province. In this address, after a recital of the grievances 
and oppressions laid upon the people of the province and of 
the necessity of guarding their rights and liberties, the follow- 
ing reference is made to the need of military preparation : 
"The improvement of the Militia in general in the Art 
Military has been therefore thought necessary, & strongly 
recommended by this Congress. We now think that par- 
ticular care should be taken by the Towns and Districts in 
this Colony, that each of the minute men not already pro- 
vided therewith, should ])e immediately equipped with an 
eifective Fire arm, Bayonet, Pouch, Knapsack, Thirty rounds 
of Cartriges and Ball, and that they be disciplined three times 
a week and oftener as opportunity may offer. To encourage 
these our worthy Countrymen to obtain the skill of complete 
soldiers, we recommend it to the Towns & Districts forth- 
with to pay their own minute men a reasonable consideration 
for their services. â€” And in case of a general Muster, their 
further services must be recompensed by the province. An 
attention to discipline the militia in general is however b}^ 
no means to be neglected." On the same day a resolve was 
passed, directing "That a Gentleman be appointed in each 
County, to apply to the Field Officers of the Regiments within 
the same, for the List of the names of the Field Officers of 
each Regiment, the number of other Officers, and the number 
of the Men therein, as well the minute men as the common 
Militia, and return the same unto Mr. Abraham Watson at 
Cambridge." 

The Second Provincial Congress, on the 9th of February, 
1775, confirmed the powers of the Committee of Safety, re- 
peated the recommendations of the previous congress relative 
to the militia, and appointed Jedediah Preble, Artemas Ward, 
Seth Pomeroy, John Thomas and William Heath, as general 
officers, ranking in the order named, to command the troops 
when called into seiwice. Feb. 14, 1775, another general 



xii INTRODUCTION. 



officer was chosen in the person of John WhitcomI). On 
the same day, a resolve was passed recommending that the 
commandino: officers of each regiment of minute-men, formed 
or to be formed, or of any separate companies, review their 
respective commands, and make return of their numbers and 
equipment to the congress at the beginning of the next ses- 
sion, and the colonels of the militia regiments of the province 
were recommended to do likewise. 

April 5, 1775, the congress passed a resolve embodying 
articles, rules and regulations for the Massachusetts army 
''that may be raised for the defence and Security of our lives, 
liberties and Estates," and on April 8, appointed delegates to 
repair to Connecticut, Rhode Island and Xew Hampshire, to, 
inform them of the determination of Massachusetts to raise 
and establish an army for her security and defence, and to 
request the co-operation of those colonies by furnishing their 
respective quotas for general defence. 

Five days later, April 13, the Committee of Safety was 
authorized to form " six Companies of the Train for the Artil- 
lery alread}' provided by this Colony to immediately enter on 
discipline, and constantly be in readiness to enter the service 
of the Colony when an Army shall be raised ; " and the com- 
mittee were empowered " to draw on the Public Treasury 
for paying said Companies a suitable consideration for their 
services." 

The events of the nineteenth of April brought matters to a 
crisis, and on Sunday, April 23, the Provincial Congress, then 
sitting at Watertown, passed the following resolves : â€” 

Resolved unanimously that it is necessary for the defence of the 
Colony that an Army of 30,000 Men be immediately raised and 
established. 

Resolved, That 13,000 Men be raised immediately by this Province. 

The Committee of Safety had already, on the 21st of April, 
resolved that an army of 8,000 men be enlisted, but this of 
course was superseded by the action of the Provincial Con- 
gress. 

On the 25th of April, it was moved and passed unanimously 
by the Provincial Congress that the companies in each regi- 



INTRODUCTION. xiii 



ment be reduced from 100 men each to 59 men, including 3 
officers. It was also moved and passed that each regiment be 
reduced to ten of such companies. 

April 2Q, the Committee of Safety resolved that as many 
men out of the minute companies asseml)led as had not already 
enlisted into the army should do so immediately, that the 
quota to be raised from the towns might l)e known as soon as 
possible. And again, on April 29, they voted that orders 
be sent to the jieighboring towns requiring that one-half the 
militia be immediately sent to Roxbury and Cani])ridge and 
the remainder hold themselves in readiness to march at a min- 
ute's warning. This was followed hy a resolve passed l)y the 
Provincial Congress on the 4th of May, providing for granting 
advance pay to soldiers enlisting in the army to be raised, and 
the sum of 20s. was allowed to each private and non-commis- 
sioned officer who should so enlist ; and two days later. Gen. 
John Whitcoml) and Col. Benjamin Lincoln were appointed 
muster masters of the Massachusetts army, to muster and 
swear in all able-bodied and effective men who should enlist, 
and to pay over the advance money to all such as passed mus- 
ter. Later, Col. Asa Whitcomb was appointed to serve as 
muster master in place of Gen. John Whitcomb, who declined 
his appointment. On the same day. May 4, the Committee 
of Safety transmitted a letter to the governor of Connecticut, 
requesting the authorities of that colony to send forward 
three or four thousand men, without delay, in consideration 
of the pressing and urgent need of the colony of Massachu- 
setts. A similar letter was sent to the governor of Rhode 
Island. 

At the sitting of May 8, 1775, the Provincial Congress 
established the form of an oath to be administered to the offi- 
cers and private soldiers of the army ; and, as such obligation 
cannot fail to be of interest, it is sriven herewith : â€” 



Resolved, That all officers and soldiers of the Massachusetts army 
now raising for the defence and security of the rights and liberties of 
this and our sister colonies in America, shall each and every of them 
excepting only the General Officers, repeat and take the following 
Oath, viz : "I, A. B., swear, I will truly & faithfully serve in the 
Massachusetts army, to which I belong, for the defence and security 



Xiv INTRODUCTION. 



of the estates, lives and liberties of the good people of this & the 
sister colonies in America, in opposition to ministerial tyrany by 
which they are or may be oppressed, and to all other enemies & 
opposers whatsoever ; that I will adhere to the rules & regulations 
of sd army, observe & obey the generals & other officers set over 
me : and disclose and make known to said officers all traiterous con- 
spiraces, attempts and designs whatsoever Avhich I shall know to be 
made against said army or any of the english american colonies, so 
help me God." 



At a later period the form of oath administered on enlist- 
ment was simplified. 

On the same day the foregoing resolve was passed, a com- 
mittee was a})i)ointed with instructions to inquire into the 
state of the army at Roxbury and Cambridge, and if they 
found the numbers thereof reduced, to advise the Committee 
of Safety to send out immediately for reinforcements. In ac- 
cordance with this resolve, it was ordered by the Committee 
of Safety that the commanding officers of the militia of the 
towns of Dorchester, Dedham, Newton, Watertown, Waltham, 
Roxbury, Milton, Braintree, Brookline and Xeedham, imme- 
diately muster half the militia and all the minute-men and 
march them forthwith to Roxbury, to strengthen the camp 
there. This action was followed, on the 10th of May, ])y a 
resolve of the Provincial Congress, directing the general offi- 
cers to call in all soldiers enlisted in the service of the colony, 
and to order all enlisted soldiers and others in camp to remain 
until further orders from the congress. On this latter date, 
also, it was resolved to augment the train of artillery from six 
companies to ten companies. 

The twentieth day of May, 1775, Gen. Artemas Ward was 
sworn and received his commission as commander-in-chief 
and commissions were issued to various colonels and other 
officers, so that the organization of the Massachusetts army, 
as it was called, may be considered as fairly entered upon at 
this date, although a large proportion of the officers and men 
had been continuousl}' in service from their arriva;l in camp 
in response to tlie alarm sent out the li)tli of April and they 
are credited with such service upon the rolls ])reserved among 
the state archives. 



INTRODUCTION. XV 



At a sitting of the Third Provincial Congress, held on the 
3d of June, 1775, a committee was appointed to consider the 
advisability of raising a reinforcement to the Massacliusetts 
army for the protection of the seacoasts. This committee 
reported, on the 7th of the same month, that it was inexpe- 
dient to augment the forces already ordered to be established ; 
but on the 17th of June it was recommended, by resolve, that 
the militia in all parts of the colony hold themselves in readi- 
ness to march at a minute's warning to the relief of any place 
that might be attacked, or to the support of the army, with 
at least twenty cartridges, or rounds of powder and l)all, and 
this recommendation was ordered to be printed and distril)- 
uted throughout the colony. It had already been resolved on 
the 13tli of June that 23 regiments be commissioned, exclusive 
of the regiment of matrosses, and on the 24th of June the con- 
gress ordered that communications be prepared and sent to 
the governments of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Xew Hamp- 
shire, appealing for haste in forwarding their respective quotas 
of reinforcements to the army, stating the dangerous position 
of affairs, the fact that the full number of men ordered to be 
raised was still deficient, and pointing out the urgent neces- 
sity of co-operation. 

The defence of the seacoasts had occupied the attention of 
congress for some time, owing to the constant appeals of the 
inhabitants thereon, and their representations as to their un- 
protected condition. Accordingly, on the 28th of June, 1775, 
resolves were reported to provide forces for their protection. 
Ten companies were ordered to be raised in Essex Co. ; nine 
companies in the counties of Plymouth and Barnstable, four 
to be stationed in Plymouth Co. and the remainder in Barn- 
stable Co. ; two companies in Bristol Co. ; four companies in 
York Co. ; five companies in Cumberland Co. ; three com- 
panies in Lincoln Co. ; and one company to l)e raised in 
Falmouth and stationed on the Elizabeth Islands. These 
companies were to consist of 50 men each, including officers, 
and were to be under the direction of the committees of cor- 
respondence of the respective towns wherein they might be 
stationed, or of a joint committee from the towns on the sea- 
coast in the county wherein they were raised, save those in 
Plymouth, Barnstable and York counties, which were to be 



Xvi INTRODUCTION. 



under the direction of the field officers of the county regiments. 
This \ras purely local service, and no term of enlistment was 
specified in the resolves ; but enlisting orders were issued to 
raise men to serve from the date of their engagement to the 
last day of December, 1775. This special force for seacoast 
defence was renewed from time to time, throughout the war, 
as the terms of service expired. 

On the oth of July, 1775, a resolve was i)assed to jn-ovide 
each of the non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the 
army authorized to l)e raised under resolve of April 23, 1775, 
with a coat, and 18,000 were ordered to be provided by the 
towns and districts, in accordance with a regular apportion- 
ment. This gift of a coat was considered in the nature of a 
bounty, and later, at the time of their distribution, the men 
in service were pennitted to choose between acceptance of 
the coat or a sum of money in lieu thereof. Although this 
distri))uti()n of coats was based on the needs of the estimated 
army of lo,600 men authorized to be raised, it is evident that 
nowhere near such a number was actually in service at the 
time of A^"ashington's assuming command of the army, as, in a 
communication addressed by him to the Provincial Congress, 
under date of July i), 1775, he states that the number of men, 
fit for duty, of the forces raised in the province did not 
amount to 9,000, all told, which, with the troops from the 
other colonies present in camp, composed an army of 14,500 
eftective men. He enclosed a copy of the conclusions of a 
council of Avar of the generals of the army, wherein it was 
agreed that the army should consist of at least 22,000 men, 
and advised the immediate filling up of the regiments to their 
intended establishment. Congress responded to this repre- 
sentation of the state of the army by })r()viding for a tempo- 
rary reinforcement, in a resolve passed July 12, 1775, wherein 
the commanding officers of the militia com})anies in the vari- 
ous towns were recommended to send forward men without 
delay, to serve for one month, until the new levies should be 
com})leted. 

The next action of the Provincial Congress toward raising 
troops was on Aug. 7, 1775, when two companies were ordered 
to be raised, for service at the eastward, in the counties of 
Cumberland and Lincoln ; said companies to ])e placed on the 



INTRODUCTION. xvil 



seacoast establishment, and to be stationed in those counties, 
in addition to one company already enlisted. Again, on Au- 
gust 16 and 19, two more companies were authorized to be 
raised on the same establishment, one to be stationed at Ma- 
chias and the other at Gouldsborough and vicinity. 

The Massachusetts army had by this time become merged 
in the continental army and the fact was formally recognized 
by a resolve })assed Aug. 14, 1775, terminating all contracts 
made for victualling the troops by the colony and transferring 
the responsibility of providing supplies to the Continental 
Commissary General. 

The need of augmenting the forces under "Washington by 
this time had manifested itself to the Continental Congress, 
for on Xov. 4, 1775, it was â€” 

Resolved, That the new army intended to lie before Boston consist 
of 20,372 men, officers included. 

In addition, the resolve provided that, if the necessity of 
the service required it, the general should be empowered to 
call forth the minute-men or militia of the Massachusetts Bay 
or the neighboring colonies ; but this was later amended by 
a resolve that such call should not be made without havinof 
applied to and obtained the consent of the officers in whom 
were vested the executive powers of government. 

It is not to be supposed that an essentially maritime peo- 
ple would be content merely with waging hostilities against a 
powerful enemy on land, and so, on Xov. 1, 1775, an act was 
passed entitled " An Act, for Encouraging the Fixing out of 
Armed Vessells, to defend the Sea Coast of America, and for 
Erecting a Court to Try and Condemn all Vessells, that shall 
be found infesting the same." This act empowered the council, 
or the major part of them, "to commission, with letters of 
marque and reprisal, any person or persons within this colony, 
who shall, at his or their own expence, fix out and equip, for 
the defence of America, any vessell, as also any person who 
shall, by the owner of such vessell, be recommended therefor; 
and that all persons so commissioned, as aforesaid, shall have 
full power, with such other persons as they shall engage to 
their assistance, to sail on the seas, attack, take and bring into 



Xviii INTRODUCTION. 



any port in this colony, all vessells offending or employed by 
the enemy as aforesaid, and also to retake and bring in, as 
aforesaid, any vessell or vessells that may be taken from any 
person or persons l)y said enemy." 

The master or owner of any vessel commissioned was re- 
quired to give bond for the proper discharge of his duties and 
for the observance of the conditions of the act above noted, and 
courts were established for the trial and condemnation of 
prizes. A court was authorized to be held at Plymouth to 
try all cases of vessels taken and brought into the counties 
of Plymouth, Barnstable, Bristol, Dukes County and Xan- 
tucket ; another, to l)e held at Ipswich, to have cognizance of 
all captures brought into Suffolk, Middlesex and Essex coun- 
ties ; and a third, to be held at North Yarmouth, to have cog- 
nizance of all captures brought into York, Cuml^erland and 
Lincoln counties. 

This act was repealed Feb. 14, 1776, when another act, bear- 
ing the same title and of the same general tenor but making 
more specific provisions for the rights of claimants to vessels 
or cargoes condemned, was passed in its stead. Later, on 
'March 19, 1776, the act of Feb. 14, 1776, w^as repealed and 
declared null and void. Another act, amending the original 
act of November, 1775, was passed April 13, 1776, and by this 
act courts for the trial and condemnation of captures were 
authorized to be held, if judged necessary or convenient, at 
Plymouth, Barnstable, Dartmouth, Boston, Salem, Ipswich, 
Newburyport, Falmouth and Pownalborough. Still another 
act in addition to the first act was passed on May 8, 1776, and 
this extended the authority of the courts estal)lished for the 
trial and condemnation of captures, to all vessels and mer- 
chandise belonging to inhaljitants of Great Britain that should 
be "taken on the high seas, or between high- water and low- 
water mark." 

Under the encouragement offered by the above enactments, 
privateering became a popular and lucrative service, and an 
active and harassing warfare was maintained for the whole 
period of the war by the privateers that swarmed from every 
port along the coast. 

As the term of enlistment of the original levies for defence 
of the seacoasts had expired, a resolve was passed Jan. 1, 



INTRODUCTION. xix 



1776, for raising 1,200 men, to serve until Dec. 31, 1776, 
unless sooner discharged, and making full provision for their 
enlistment and esta])lishment and directing the various points 
at which they should be stationed for service. Four addi- 
tional companies were authorized to be raised for similar ser- 
vice at the eastward, on the same establishment, by a resolve 
of Jan. 13, 1776. 

The beginning of a state naval establishment appears Jan. 
11, 1776, when it was proposed that two ships should be built 
at the expense of the colony, one to carry 36 guns and the 
other to carry 32 guns ; l)ut the resolve was ordered to be re- 
committed before its final passage, and the committee were 
directed to report an estimate of the expense of building and 
furnishing said vessels. Nothing more would seem to have 
been done in the matter until Feb. 7, 1776, when a resolve 
was passed for Ixiilding at the public expense ten sloops of war 
of 110 or 115 tens each, and appointing a committee to provide 
materials and employ proper persons to build said vessels and 
appropriating the sum of Â£10,000 for the purpose. On Feb. 
17, 1776, however, the committee were empowered to suspend 
contracting for more than five vessels of the description given, 
and were authorized to purchase and equip five vessels already 
built of any rig or dimension they might consider suitable. 

On the 19th of January, 1776, a resolve was passed in com- 
pliance with a request from General Washington, authorizing 
the enlistment of a regiment to reinforce the army in Canada ; 
said regiment to be enlisted from the counties of Berkshire 
and Hampshire, to consist of 728 men, including officers, and 
to serve until the first of January, 1777, if required. At a 
later date, viz., Feb. 10, 1776, in order to encourage enlist- 
ments for this service, a bounty of 40s. in lawful money was 
ofiered in place of the two months' advance wages first prom- 
ised. This fact is interesting as being the first direct offer of 
a money bounty for enlistment made in the war. 

This call for troops was followed immediately by a resolve 
of Jan. 20, 1776, intended to meet the application of General 
Washington for a temporary reinforcement to strengthen the 
army investing Boston and maintain the lines and fortifica- 
tions about the town. The colonies of Connecticut and New 
Hampshire had also been applied to for reinforcements and 



XX INTRODUCTION. 



the quota required from Massachusetts was fixed at 4,368 men. 
This quota was apportioned to the various towns and districts 
of the colony hy the resolve and it directed that the com- 
manding officer of each company of militia, in the towns men- 
tioned, should muster his command without delay and cause 
such number of men to enlist voluntarily as was set for each 
town's proportion ; said soldiers to serve, on the continental 
estal)lisliment, from the date of their enlistment to the first 
day of April, 1776. The men enlisted were to be formed into 
companies of 90 men each and were to be assembled into six 
regiments and the same pay and allowances were granted 
them as were allowed to the men who had previously enlisted. 

The need of regulating the militia and making them more 
availa])le, l)oth for local service and for responding to calls or 
drafts for reinforcements to the continental army, by this time 
had become evident, and on Jan. 22, 1776, an act was passsd 
for " Forming and Regulating the Militia within the Colony 
of the Massachusetts Bay, in New England etc.," and repeal- 
ing all former acts made for that purpose. In accordance with 
the provisions thereof, John Hancock, Azor Orne and Benj. 
Lincoln, were chosen as 1st, 2d and 3d major generals, respec- 
tively, of the militia of the colony, under date of Feb. 8, 1776, 
according to the records of the Provincial Congress. Brigadiers 
for the various counties were chosen at the same time, and 
later, Feb. 20, 1776, upon the report of a committee appointed 
to arrange the militia, the number of regiments to each county 
was fixed and established as follows : Suffolk Co., 5 regiments ; 
Essex Co., 8 regiments ; Middlesex Co., 7 regiments ; Hamp- 
shire Co., 6 regiments; Plymouth Co., 4 regiments; Barn- 
stable Co., 4 regiments ; Bristol Co., 4 regiments ; York Co., 
4 regiments ; Dukes Co., 2 regiments ; Worcester Co., 8 regi- 
ments ; Cumberland Co., 4 regiments; Lincoln Co., 6 regi- 
ments; Berkshire Co., 2 regiments. 

Various measures were taken from time to time to insure 
the prompt response of the local militia to requests from the 
general commanding the army for temporary reinforcements, 
l)ut no further calls for trooi)S seem to have been made until 
April it, 1776, when, in conse(pience of the evacuation of 
Boston and the necessity for placing it in a proper state of 
defence, and also because, in the Judgment of the General 



INTRODUCTION. xxi 



Court, the continental forces left and stationed about the town 
were insufficient for such purpose, ei^rht companies, of 90 
men each, were ordered to be raised, to constitute one regi- 
ment and to serve from date of enlistment to Dec. 1, 1776. 
Later, that is, on April ^^^ 1776, a part of the seacoast 
defence forces were ordered to join and co-operate with this 
regiment in service at and about Boston ; and on May 3, 1776, 
a company of artillery was ordered to be raised for the same 
service, but for.a longer term, viz., from enlistment to May 
2, 1777. 

An act was passed May 3, 1776, authorizing a regiment of 
horse to be raised out of the several regiments of foot in the 
county of Worcester, to consist of eight companies of fifty 
able-bodied, eftective men, exclusive of officers ; the same to 
be raised by voluntary enlistments out of the training band or 
alarm list indiscriminately. This regiment was not raised for 
any special service, but to form a component part of the militia 
and to be governed by the laws provided for the regulation 
thereof. 

Again, on May 7, 1776, another regiment, of 728 men, was 
ordered to be raised for the defence of Boston, to serve until 
Dec. 1, 1776, and six more companies of artillery were also 
provided for, to form, with the company previously mentioned, 
an artillery regiment and to serve for one year. Each soldier 
enlisting in these regiments was allowed, in addition to the 
usual sums for pay and travel allowance, a blanket, or 13.s. 4(7. 
in lieu thereof, on passing muster. 

These measures seem to have sufficed for a time for local 
defence and the next call for troops was in response to a 
request from the Continental Congress that Massachusetts 
furnish her quota to reinforce the armies in Canada and Xew 
York. Accordingly, on June 25, 1776, a resolve was passed, 
directing that the necessary number of .5,000 men (3,000 
destined for Canada and 2,000 for service at Xew York) be 
immediately raised from the training band and alarm lists, 
constituting the militia of the colony, in the proportions 
affixed to the various towns mentioned in a schedule embodied 
in the resolve, to serve until the first of December, 1776 ; the 
forces raised in the counties of Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, 
Hampshire, York and Cumberland, to be destined for Canada, 



Xxii INTRODUCTION, 



and to be formed into four battalions of 750 men each ; while 
those raised in the counties of Plymouth, Bristol, Worcester 
and Berkshire, to be destined for New York, and to be formed 
into three ))attalions of 6(30 men each, as nearly as possible. 
The bounty for the Canada service was fixed at Â£7, and for 
the New York service at Â£3 ; the same to be paid to each 
non-commissioned officer and soldier on passing muster. 

On the 25th of June, 1776, another call was made by the 
Continental Congress, this time for an augmentation of the 
forces destined for Canada or the Northern department ; Massa- 
chusetts being requested to furnish at once two regiments or 
1,500 men. It was proposed to forward the number called 
for out of the regiments already in service at and about 
Boston ; but the project was evidently not carried out, for it 
was resolved by the General Court on July 11, 1776, to raise 
two regiments to reinforce the troops destined for Canada, in 
accordance with the requisition of the Continental Congress, 
by a draft of every twenty-fifth man in the training band and 
alai-m lists, exclusive of those already raised or ordered to 
be raised; said regiments to serve until Dec. 1, 1776, unless 
sooner discharged. This was the first actual draft made, and 
it was provided that, if more than the numl^er necessary for 
the two regiments resulted from the draft, they should be 
marched to the works or forts at or near Boston and re- 
main subject to the orders and regulations of the council. 
The resolve also provided for the enforcement of the draft, 
by directing that if the number required was not enlisted 
from any town or plantation without delay and other attempts 
proved ineffectual, a draft should be made on a muster of 
the whole militia of such town or ])lantati()n ; and in case 
any person neglected to attend such muster, it was provided 
he should forfeit and pay a fine of Â£10 ; and, in case any 
person drafted should neglect or refuse to go upon such ser- 
vice, or neglect to procure an able-1)odied, efi'ective man in 
his stead, it was provided he should forfeit and pay the sum 
of Â£10; such fines, when imposed, to be })aid within twenty- 
four hours, on penalty of an additional fine of Â£3. The same 
system of draft and forfeitures was made to apply to those 
towns which were delinquent in furnishing their proportion 
of the 5,000 men needed for New York and Canada. 



INTRODUCTIOX. xxiii 



Another draft soon became necessary, in consequence of the 
critical situation of the continental army at New York ; and 
on Sept. 12, 1776, a resolve was passed for making a draft 
from the militia of every fifth able-bodied man under fifty 
years of age, save certain persons exempted by reason of oc- 
cupation. Certain towns and counties were excepted from 
the provisions of this resolve, owing to their need of local 
security and defence. Penalties and forfeitures were imposed 
by this resolve similar to those quoted previously, with the 
addition of a term of imprisonment, not exceeding two 
months, for refusal to march or procure a substitute by any 
person drafted, upon conviction on an indictment or present- 
ment hy the grand jury of the county wherein said ofilence 
was committed. The troops so raised were to serve until re- 
called by the General Court, but later a term of two months 
was fixed for this service. The destination of one battalion 
was diverted, however, from New York to Rhode Island. 

For the purpose of obtaining prompt and responsible direc- 
tion of all military affairs a Board of War was established by a 
resolve of Oct. 26, 1776, which was to consist of nine persons, 
with power to order and direct the operation of the forces in 
the pay of the state, on land or sea, and provide all necessary 
stores, munitions of war, etc., for the purpose of carrying on 
the war. 

The short terms of service required by drafts and enlist- 
ments, added to the probable deficiencies, notwithstanding the 
penalties imposed, made frequent calls necessary ; and on 
Nov. 14, 1776, was passed "An Act for providing a Rein- 
forcement to the American Army." This act provided that 
one-quarter part of all the al)le-bodied male persons within 
the state, from sixteen years and upward, not in actual mili- 
tary service (with certain exem})tions), either by voluntary 
enlistment, lot or draft, should be appointed and held in read- 
iness to march at a minute's warning, to serve for a term not 
exceeding three months, within and for the defence of any of 
the United States, when called out to reinforce the conti- 
nental army by the General Court, or, in the recess thereof, 
by the council. It was provided, however, that in case the 
persons drafted or enlisting were not called into service l)efore 
March 1, 1777, they should no longer be held under engage- 



Xxiv INTRODUCTION. 



ment. Fines, forfeitures and imprisonment, were imposed by 
this act for failure to comj)ly with its provisions. 

In order to replace the regiments stationed at and al)Out 
Boston, whose terms of service were about expiring, sixteen 
companies were ordered to be raised by a resolve of Dec. 5, 
1776, to be enlisted for the term of three years, unless sooner 
discharged. It was provided that the two regiments so raised 
should be employed in defence of the several posts in and near 
the harbor of Boston, but be obliged to do duty in any other 
part of the state if called upon to do so by the General Court 
or council. 

Both legislature and people had become accustomed to the 
idea of long-term enlistments at this period, as the process of 
engaging men already in the service to enlist for three years 
or during the war, had been going on for some time, and dur- 
ing the last three months of the year 177G the General Court 
had passed various resolves for the encouragement of such 
enlistments. The Continental Congress had pointed out to 
all the colonies the fetal weakness of short-term enlistments 
and had called upon Massachusetts to furnish her quota of 
fifteen battalions to the continental army to serve for the 
longer term. The General Court had responded by agreeing 
to pay 20s. per month and a bounty of Â£20 to every soldier 
who would so enlist, in addition to the continental pay. 
Another resolve, of Jan. 26, 1777, ordered that the command- 
ing officers of the militia companies and regiments should 
muster their commands and cause to be enlisted, to com})lete 
the fifteen battalions required, a number of men equal to one- 
seventh part of all the male inhal^itants of each town or plan- 
tation, of the age of sixteen years or upward, to serve for 
three years or during the war, and to be in readiness to 
march by the last day of February, 1777. 

This resolve is noteworthy because it exempted none but 
Quakers. 

In response to the urgent application of General Washington, 
that every effort l)e made to raise without delay the regiment 
of artillery assigned as part of the quota of Massachusetts, a 
resolve was passed March 11, 1777, offering a bounty of Â£20 
to each non-commissioned officer and soldier who should enlist 
for three years or during the war in said regiment. Said 



INTRODUCTION. XXV 



bounty was in the form of treasurer's notes of the denomi- 
nation of Â£10, payable in four years from their date, witli in- 
terest to be paid annually at the rate of six per cent. This 
was the regular bounty ofi'ered by the state for continental 
enlistments at that time, but on the ground that it was not 
necessary for persons enlisting into an artillery regiment to 
equip themselves, as was the case with those who went into 
the marching regiments, the bounty in this instance was re- 
duced to Â£15.10. 

The next call for troops, however, was for short-term 
service, as on April 12, 1777, a resolve was passed ordering 
2,000 of the militia to be detached from the various county 
regiments for service at Rhode Island, or elsewhere in Xew 
England, as ordered, and to serve for a period of two months, 
unless sooner discharged. It also became necessary to pro- 
vide anew for the seacoast defence and a resolve of April 
21, 1777, directed several companies of artillery (four full 
companies and six partial detachments) to be raised and sta- 
tioned at various points, to serve until Dec. 31, 1777, and 
replace those whose enlistments had expired. 

The men engaged under this resolve, however, were held 
equally liable with the ordinary militia to drafts for service 
outside of the state. 

It havins: been recommended bv General Washington that 
an effort be made to raise three battalions in addition to the 
fifteen allotted to this state, a resolve was passed April 30, 
1777, offering a bounty of Â£20 to every non-commissioned 
oflScer and soldier who should enlist into said battalions, pro- 
vided he furnished and equipped himself. In case he was 
unable to comply with this requirement then the bounty paid 
was to be only Â£15.10. 

The fear lest the enemy should seize upon the important 
post of Ticonderoga before the continental forces being raised 
could proceed thither caused the General Court to pass a re- 
solve on April 30, 1777, directing 1,500 men to be detached 
without delay from the militia of the county of Hampshire to 
march to Ticonderoga and there do duty for the term of two 
months unless sooner discharged. 

Various resolves to compel the towns to furnish their pro- 
portion of the quota of fifteen battalions for the continental 



XXVI INTRODUCTION. 



service, were passed from time to time, but they seem to have 
proved ineffective for the purpose, as on April 30, 1777, a re- 
solve was passed directing that in such towns and plantations 
as should fail to enlist by May 15, 1777, their proportion of 
one-seventh part of the male inhabitants as called for by the 
resolve of Jan. 26, 1777, a draft should l)e made to complete 
the number required. The resolve i)rovided that persons 
drafted should either serve, procure a substitute, or pay a 
fine, l)ut permitted those drafted to choose the term for which 
they should serve, viz., either to Jan. 10, 1778, or for three 
years, or for during the war. The next direct call for troops 
came in the shape of a resolve, dated May 5, 1777, directing 
that two regiments of infantry be raised for the defence and 
security of Boston harbor, to serve for one year from May 1, 
1777. ^ 

An attempt to strike a blow at Great Britain by the way of 
Nova Scotia next engaged the attention of the General Court ; 
and a resolve of June 7, 1777, authorized the raising of a 
regiment of 728 men and a single company of artillery, in the 
eastern counties, to serve for a term not exceeding six months, 
and to proceed upon an expedition to the River St. John's. 
This expedition was to cause a diversion in favor of the 
colonists, by relieving the exposed settlements at the eastward 
from the aggressions of the British forces in that neighbor- 
hood and by arousing and taking advantage of the active aid 
and support of those inhalntants of Nova Scotia who were in 
sympathy with the United States in their struggle for inde- 
pendence. It was even proposed to enlist a regiment in Nova 
Scotia, should the expedition gain a foothold there and the 
resolve provided for such enlistment. But the affair came to 
naught. Certain of the inhabitants of that province did, how- 
ever, enlist and serve to the credit of Massachusetts and their 
service duly appears upon rolls in the state's collection of 
Revolutionary records. 

The peculiarly exposed situation of Rhode Island and the 
necessity of keeping up the Massachusetts contingent of militia 
detached to co-operate with the local forces, caused the pas- 
sage of a resolve on June 24, 1777, for the detachment of 
1,500 men from the militia, apportioned among the brigades 
of the various counties, to serve until Jan. 10, 1778, the term 



INTRODUCTION. xxvii 



of those previously detached to that state expiring July 10, 
1777. A resolve of June 27, 1777, made additional provision 
for this service and directed that two regiments be raised to 
serve for the term of six months from July 1, 1777. 

It became again necessary to order out a portion of the 
militia to reinforce the Xorthern army, and on July 2, 1777, 
it was resolved that the brigadiers of the counties of Berkshire 
and Hampshire should cause to be mustered and marched to 
Fort EdwarcLor Fort Ann, as many of the militia as they could 
get together for the purpose ; said detachments to serv^e until 
the army could be otherwise reinforced. 

Aug. 6, 1777, a resolve was passed directing the Board of 
War either to purchase or build two armed vessels, to mount 
28 or 32 guns each, and tit them out for the service and on 
account of the state. 

The critical position of the American forces after the cap- 
ture of Ticonderoga by the British caused the General Court 
to pass a resolve, on Aug. 9, 1777, directing that one-sixth 
part of the able-bodied men of the training band and alarm 
lists, not engaged in the service, be at once drafted by the 
brigadiers of the several counties mentioned in the resolve, 
and marched without delay to reinforce the army at the north- 
ward and that they be continued in the service until Nov. 30, 
1777, unless sooner discharged. 

The state's proportion of the continental army being still 
mcomplete, owing to the delinquency of many towns and 
plantations, a resolve was passed, dated Aug. 15, 1777, im- 
posing severe penalties on all military officers, selectmen and 
others, who should fail in any way to obey the provisions of 
the resolve, which directed that a number of men equivalent 
to one-seventh part of the male inhabitants of said delincjuent 
towns or plantations be enlisted for three years or during the 
war, or drafted for the term of eight months, in order to fill 
up the deficient regiments. 

A secret expedition, as it was called, which had for its des- 
tination Rhode Island, was projected in September, 1777, and 
a resolve of Sept. 16, 1777, directed that a force of 3,000 men, 
to be made up into four battalions, with one company of artil- 
lery, should be detached from the militia of certain counties, 
to serve for thirty days from Oct. 1, 1777. The governors 



XXviii INTRODUCTION. 



of Rhode Island and Connecticut were to be made acquainted 
with the preparations for the expedition and requested to co- 
operate. 

The need of providing a force for the protection of the set- 
tlements to the eastward of Cumberland Co. caused the pas- 
sage of a resolve on Sept. 16, 1777, directing that 800 men, 
to form three companies, should l)e raised and kept stationed 
at Machias until Dec. 31, 1777, unless sooner discharged. 
Two local companies temporarily in service at Machias were 
also authorized to be enlisted for the same term and ui)on the 
same establishment. The resolve also appointed Col. John 
Allan to command the Indians in the eastern department, and 
he was empowered to take into the service and pay of the 
state such Indians as he should l)e able to procure and should 
consider necessary. 

No further drafts or calls for troops appear until Dec. 13, 
1777, when a resolve was passed, recommending the men of 
the two regiments serving in Rhode Island whose term of en- 
listment was to expire Jan. 1, 1778, to re-engage in the same 
service for twelve months from that date. A bounty of Â£12 
and the same pay and allowances as were granted to soldiers 
serving in the continental army were offered as inducements. 

Jan. 17, 1778, a resolve wae passed declaring null and void 
the resolve of Aug. 6, 1777, by which the Board of War were 
authorized to build two armed vessels, on the ground that the 
proposed vessels were too large for the purpose intended, and 
they were empowered to j)rocure suitalile materials for two 
vessels to mount 16 or 20 guns each. 

At the request of General Heath, that the General Court 
should furnisli him a detachment of militia to serve as guards 
at and al)out Boston for the greater security of the public 
stores lodged there, a resolve was passed Feb. 7, 1778, direct- 
ing that 400 men be detached from certain regiments to serve 
as guards for the term of three months. 

Another detachment of 500 men from the militia, to serve 
as guards under Major-General Heath at and about Boston, 
was authorized ])y a resolve of March 11, 1778, and an addi- 
tional number of 1,064 men was ordered to be detached for 
the purpose of relieving the guards stationed at Cambridge, 
and to serve from April 2, 1778, to July 2, 1778. 



INTRODUCTION. xxix 



The need of making further provision for seacoast defence 
presented itself and a resolve was passed March 12, 1778, 
authorizing the enlistment of the various companies and de- 
tachments of artillery needed to replace those whose terms of 
service were about to expire. The resolve fixed the number 
of men to be raised for the various places where forces were 
kept stationed, and directed that they should be enlisted to 
serve to Jan. 1, 1779. 

Upon a request of the Continental Congress, that a detach- 
ment of the militia be called out to co-operate with those of 
other states in fortifying and securing the passes of the North 
River, a resolve was passed April 20, 1778, authorizing the 
brigadiers of certain counties to detach from their respective 
brigades a number of men, amounting in all to 1,300, to march 
to Peekskill and serve for the term of eight months from the 
time of their arrival at place of rendezvous. Two hundred 
men were also directed to be detached from the counties of 
Barnstable and Bristol, to serve for the term of eight months, 
as a reinforcement to the troops serving at Rhode Island. 

Another attempt was made by the General Court to bring 
up the quota of the fifteen battalions of the continental army 
to their desired efficiency, by a resolve passed April 20, 1778, 
which directed that all the companies of the county regiments 
be assembled, on or before the 11th of May following, and 
that their officers cause the number assigned to each town as 
requisite to complete the quota, to be raised by draft, lot or 
voluntary enlistment, to serve for the term of nine mouths 
from the time of their arrival at Fishkill. The number appor- 
tioned to be raised was 2,000. Very severe penalties were 
laid upon any and all who should neglect or evade compliance 
with the provisions of the resolve, and a fine of Â£100 for every 
man deficient was to be incurred by any town or plantation 
that had not provided its full assigned number by May 20, 
1778. It was also recommended to the various towns to en- 
deavor to raise volunteers to serve for the term of six months. 

By a resolve of May 1, 1778, gratuities were authorized to 
be paid to all officers and soldiers who had joined the conti- 
nental army for three years or during the war, and who could 
be certified by their commanding officers as having been in 
camp on or before Aug. 15, 1777 ; $150 was granted to each 



XXX INTRODUCTION. 



field oflScer, $120 to each captain, subaltern and staft' officer, 
and $100 to each non-commissioned officer and soldier. 
Another resolve of the same date provided that the neces- 
sary funds for these gratuities should be raised by a lottery 
or lotteries. 

The next resolve concerning troops is dated June 12, 1778, 
and it directed that 1,800 men be detached from the brigades 
of militia in the various counties, to serve from the time of 
their enlistment to Jan. 1, 1779 ; the men so detached to be 
forwarded, part to the army at the northward, part to Rhode 
Island, and the remainder to be stationed at various seaport 
towns. The selectmen of the various towns were authorized 
to pay out of the town treasuries Â£14, as bounty or hire, to 
each man so detached and mustered, and were empowered to 
assess a tax upon the polls and estates of their respective 
towns to replace the money so paid. 

An alarm caused by the prospect of an attack upon Rhode 
Island and the pressing need of immediate reinforcements in 
that quarter, brought about the passage of a resolve on June 
16, 1778, directing that the colonels of certain militia regi- 
ments detach from their respective commands a number of 
men, amounting in all to 554, who were to be forwarded with- 
out delay to General Sullivan's headquarters, and there do 
duty until the forces previously ordered to be raised for ser- 
vice in Rhode Island should be available. The resolve ex- 
pressly provided, however, that the term of service should 
not exceed twenty-one days from the time of arrival at place 
appointed. 

In addition to the forces needed for active service and for 
the seacoast defence, it had been found necessary to provide 
guards for the various public stores and magazines throughout 
the state and for the troops of the convention (Burgoyne's 
army) . As the time for which those engaged in this service 
was about to expire, a special enlistment was authorized for 
the purpose, and on June 18, 1778, a resolve was passed di- 
recting that 1,000 men be detached from the militia, to serve 
as iruards under General Heath, at the various ])laces designated 
by him, from the time of enlistment or detachment to Jan. 1, 
1771), unless sooner discharged. It was provided that any 
person detached for this service who should not within twenty- 



mTRODUCTIOX. xxxi 



four hours pay a fine of Â£10 or provide an able-bodied, efl'ec- 
tive man to serve in his stead should be considered as a 
soldier in said detachment, and treated as such unless he could 
procure from the selectmen or committee of the town or plan- 
tation to which he belonged a certificate that he was not, in 
their opinion, able to serve in person nor of sufficient circum- 
stances to pay the fine. It was also provided that men enlisted 
or detached should be held and returned for the towns whereof 
they were inhaWtants and no other, and Â£5 per month, in ad- 
dition to the continental pay, was promised by the state as an 
encouragement to such as would enter the service. 

The possibility of an attack upon the French fleet, then 
lying in Boston harbor, and the consequent danger of the 
town, caused a resolve to be passed on Sept. 17, 1778, direct- 
ing that a number of men, equal to one-third part of the train 
band and alarm list, should be detached from the militia of 
certain of the counties (those of Berkshire, Barnstable, Cum- 
berland and Lincoln counties, with one brigade in Bristol Co. 
and two regiments in Plymouth Co., being excepted) to serve 
at and about Boston, or elsewhere, as directed, until Jan. 1, 
1779. 

At the request of Major-General Gates, who informed the 
General Court that he stood in need of men to gruard the 
works and magazines at Boston and vicinity, a resolve was 
passed Jan. 26, 1779, providing for raising 400 men for the 
purpose, to be formed into four companies and to serve for 
the term of three months. 

Further provision was made for the seacoast defence by a 
resolve of Jan. 29, 1779, which provided for raising the neces- 
sary detachments of artillery to replace those whose terms had 
expired and fixing their term of service to extend to Dec. 31, 
1779. 

An enlistment of a special nature was authorized soon after, 
owing to the representation of General Heath that it was 
necessary and important that a force of guards should be 
regularly maintained at Boston, Rutland and Springfield, in- 
stead of depending upon detachments from the militia from 
time to time. Accordingly, by a resolve passed April 15, 
1779, four companies, of 100 men each, were authorized to 
be enlisted to serve as sruards at and about Boston, and two 



XXxii INTRODUCTION. 



companies, of 50 men each, for similar duty, one to serve at 
Rutland and one at Springfield. Said companies of guards 
were to be enlisted for three months and to be renewed by 
three months' terms until no longer necessary. 

The situation in Rhode Island again called for attention, 
and on April 1(5, 1779, a resolve was passed, authorizing the 
raising of a regiment of Light Infantry, to serve for eleven 
months from May 1, 1779, and directing them to be marched 
as soon as raised to that state, there to do duty until the 
further order of the General Court. 

April 19, 1779, an act was passed empowering the Board of 
War to purchase and tit out two armed vessels, and an appro- 
priation of Â£50,000, to be raised by a tax levy on the polls 
and estates, real and personal, within the state, was author- 
ized for the })urpose. 

Another resolve providing forces to serve at Rhode Island 
was passed April 27, 1779, when the General Court requested 
the council to detach 500 men from the militia of Suffolk, 
Middlesex, Worcester, Plymouth and Bristol counties, and 
order them to march without loss of time to Rhode Island, to 
serve until July 1, 1779. 

There was no lack of effort on the part of the General 
Court to keep up the state's quota of the continental army 
to its full numl)er and efficiency, but, notwithstanding their 
addresses, appeals and resolutions, it seems to have been con- 
stantly necessary to provide for the enlistment of men for that 
service. Another of the many resolves to accomplish this 
purpose was passed May 1, 1779, which directed that 1,500 
men he enlisted to serve in the continental army during the 
remainder of the war ; and, to encourage enlistments, the state 
offered a ])ounty of $100 in addition to the $200 offered by the 
Continental Congress, said bounty to be paid each man on 
passing muster, and an additional sum of $200 was promised 
at the expiration of six months service. 

The next call was to provide troops for service at Rhode 
Island, in order to keep up the Massachusetts contingent 
called for by the agreement entered into by the New England 
states, July 30, 1777, that troops should be furnished for the 
defence of Rhode Island as long as the enemy maintained a 
force there. Accordingly, a resolve was passed June 8, 1779, 



IXTRODUCTIOX. XXXIU 



directing that 800 .men, or eight companies, shoukl ])e raised 
or detached from the militia of the various counties, according 
to a stated apportionment, to serve from date of enlistment 
or detachment, until Jan. 1, 1780, unless sooner discharged. 
In this resolve it was directed that the selectmen of the various 
towns pay to each non-commissioned officer and private, so 
detached and nuistered, the sum of Â£30 on passing muster, 
as hire or l)ount3', the same to be recovered into the town 
treasuries by a. tax assessed upon the polls and estates of 
said towns, and all sums so advanced for bounties or hire 
were to be deducted from the next state tax imposed. 

This call was immediately followed by one for a reinforce- 
ment to the continental army, issued in consequence of a 
requisition made by the Continental Congress and embodied 
in a resolve dated June 9, 1779, which directed that 2,000 
men be raised by draft, lot or voluntary enlistment, from the 
militia of the state, each town or plantation furnishing its 
stated proportion, and the men so raised to be engaged for a 
term of nine months from the time of arrival at a place of 
rendezvous . 

The British having effected a lodgment at Penobscot, a 
resolve was passed June 24, 1779, directing the Board of War 
to engage as many private armed vessels as they considered 
suitable, to join with the continental and state armed vessels 
in an expedition to dislodge the enemy. The owners of such 
vessels were promised that all losses and damages incurred 
during the expedition would be made good by the state, and 
the officers and seamen were to receive the same pay and 
allowances as those of the continental navy. 

Provision was made for land forces to co-operate with the 
fleet that was to proceed against Penobscot, in a resolve dated 
June 25, 1779, which directed that the brigadiers of Cumber- 
land and Lincoln counties should each detach 600 men from 
their respective brigades to serve for the term of two months 
from the time of their arrival at Penobscot, unless sooner 
discharged. The resolve also provided that such men as had 
been previously ordered to be raised in the counties above 
named, as part of the state's quota of the continental army, 
should be considered part of the said detachments, and in case 
the expedition was carried into effect, the counties were to 



XXXIV INTRODUCTION. 



be exempted, for the term of nine months, from raising men 
for the regular continental service. 

Another urgent call from the commander-in-chief of the 
continental army for reinforcements caused the passage of a 
resolve on Oct. 9, 1779, directing that 2,000 men, to serve for 
three months, ])e raised from the militia of certain of the coun- 
ties, the number proportioned to each being duly specitied. 

A resolve to provide the necessary guards for seacoast 
defence was passed Dec. 25, 1779, authorizing the number 
required, to be enlisted to serve until Jan. 1, 1781. 

It was again found necessary to increase the naval establish- 
ment of the state, and on March 21, 1780, a resolve was passed 
directing the Board of War to jirocure and fit out two armed 
vessels, to carry from 12 to IG guns each. The sum of 
Â£100,000 was appropriated for the purpose, to be derived 
from the sale of confiscated estates and the rents of absentees' 
estates, in addition to the proceeds of the sale of one of the 
state vessels already in commission. 

The exposed condition of the eastern parts of the state (what 
is now Maine) and the continual encroachments and depreda- 
tions of the enemy, made it a matter of necessity that an estab- 
lished force for local defence should l)e provided, instead of 
depending upon desultory detachments of the militia as occa- 
sion required, and accordingly a resolve was passed on March 
25, 1780, directing that 600 men, in addition to two companies 
previously raised, should be detached from the militia of York, 
Cumberland and Lincoln counties to serve for the term of eight 
months. It was provided that the men raised should form one 
regiment and be stationed as follows : 100 men at Machias, 200 
at Camden and the remainder at Falmouth. 

Again, on June 5, 1780, another resolve for the purpose of 
supplying reinforcements to the continental army was passed, 
this time directing that 3,964 men be raised by draft, lot or 
voluntary enlistment, from the various towns and plantations, 
according to a stated schedule, to serve for a term of six 
months from time of arrival at a })lace of rendezvous. In this 
resolve it was provided that a fine of Â£150 should be imposed 
upon any person drafted, if considered of ability to pay it, who 
failed to pass muster or was not able to do eft'ective service, or 
who should neglect to hire an able-l)odied man to serve in his 



INTRODUCTION. XXXV 



stead ; and the fine was to be paid within twenty-four hours 
after being drafted, failing which, it was to be collected by 
levy and warrant of distress on his goods and chattels. It was 
also provided that any able-bodied man who was drafted and 
should fail to pay a fine of Â£150 for his release from duty, 
within twenty-four hours after notice of draft, should be con- 
sidered as a soldier, to every inteiit and })urpose, for the full 
term of the draft, and be subject to the penalties for desertion 
in case of furthoi' neglect or refusal to perform service. 

An earnest request from General Washington, that in addition 
to the state's regular quota, a reinforcement of militia should 
be furnished him for the approaching campaign, brought about 
the passage of a resolve on June 22, 1780, directing that 4,726 
men (the number called for) should be raised from the militia 
by draft, lot or voluntary enlistment, to serve for three months 
from the time of their arrival at Claverack on the Hudson. 

Another attem})t to supply the deficiency in the state's pro- 
portion of the continental forces was made in a resolve dated 
Dec. 2, 1780, in which, after making a patriotic appeal to the 
people and pointing out the danger and folly of short-term 
enlistments, the General Court directed that there be immedi- 
ately raised out of the militia of the state, by voluntary en- 
listment, 4,240 men, to serve for three years or during the 
war. A bounty of $50 for each man enlisted and passing mus- 
ter was promised to every town or plantation which should fill 
up its quota on or before Jan. 1, 1781, and deliver the men to 
a receiving officer ; and all sums or bounties paid by towns to 
procure men were to be credited to them in the next state tax. 
The inhabitants of towns were also permitted to form them- 
selves into classes for the procuring of men, each class to 
hire or engage one able-bodied man for the service, and the 
same bounty was to be allowed these classes as allowed the 
towns. 

The comparatively unprotected condition of the eastern part 
of the Commonwealth aorain eng'ao'ed the attention of the Gen- 
eral Court, and on March 2, 1781, a resolve was passed that 
the men raised or to be raised for the continental quota, under 
the resolve of Dec. 2, 1780, in the counties of York, Cumber- 
berland and Lincoln, should be detained for service in said 
counties until the pleasure of the Continental Congress and of 



XXXVi INTRODUCTION. 



the commander-in-chief should be known in the matter. The 
governor was also requested to write to General Washington 
and inform liim of the critical position of affairs at the cast- 
ward, and desire him to order that the troops raised should be 
retained for local service. Provision was also made for hiring 
two armed sloops for coast defence, to be employed until Dec. 
1, 1781, upon the regular pay and allowances established for 
vessels in the service of the Commonwealth. 

As the method of procuring soldiers to enlist for the con- 
tinental service hy classes which combined to pay the bounty 
or hire of a soldier, had proven more successful than any 
other means adopted, the General Court resolved on Feb. 26, 
1781, that the selectmen and assessors of all deficient towns 
or plantations should class their inhabitants and such others as 
were liable to pay taxes therein into as many classes as they 
were deficient in their assigned number. It was provided that, 
if any class so formed should neglect to procure, and have ac- 
cepted ])y the designated muster master, a soldier to serve for 
three years or during the war, by March 25, 1781, said class 
should be assessed the average amount of bounty paid to 
soldiers engaging in the continental service, with 25 per cent, 
added ; the sum so assessed to ])e collected in the manner 
authorized for the collection of town taxes. 

The next call was made in consequence of a letter from 
General Kochaml)eau stating the prolxibility of a sudden at- 
tack upon Rhode Island ; and in response thereto, the General 
Court passed a resolve on Feb. 28, 1781, authorizing the gov- 
ernor to issue orders for a body of 1,200 men to be detached 
from various militia regiments for the term of forty days and 
marched without delay to do duty at Rhode Island. It was 
further resolved that the governor might direct any numl)er 
of the militia that he should consider necessary, to hold them- 
selves in readiness to march at a minute's warning, and order 
them to Rhode Island whenever in his judgment it became 
expedient to do so. 

The depredations committed by the vessels of the enemy 
upon the unprotected settlements at the eastward, and the 
continued appeals of the inhal)itants of that section for assist- 
ance and protection, caused the passage of a resolve on March 
2, 1781, ofiering as an inducement to private armed vessels 



INTRODUCTIOX. XXXVii 



that should capture and bring into port, or destroy, any ves- 
sel belonging to the enemy found infesting the sea coasts of 
York, Cumberland and Lincoln counties, or cruising within 
five leagues thereof, bounties as follows : for each cannon 
mounted on such vessel and carrying 2 pound shot, Â£50 ; for 
each cannon mounted as aforesaid, carrying 3 })ound sliot, 
Â£60 ; for each cannon mounted as aforesaid, carrying 4 pound 
shot, Â£70; for each cannon mounted as aforesaid, carrying 6 
pound shot, Â£80 ; for each cannon mounted as aforesaid, car- 
rying 9 pound shot, Â£120 ; and for each man taken on board 
such vessel and belonging to the same, who should ])e deliv- 
ered to the commissary of prisoners, the sum of Â£6. The gov- 
ernor was also requested to write to the admiral of the French 
fleet, desiring him to order one, and if possi])le, two, of the 
frigates under his command, to make a cruise to the eastward, 
and it was resolved that it was expedient that one of the state 
armed vessels should be fitted out for a similar purpose. Ad- 
ditional measures were taken to protect the eastern settlements 
by a resolve passed April 24, 1781, which directed that three 
companies, 240 men in all, should be raised in York, Cumber- 
land and Lincoln counties for local defence, to serve until Dec. 
1, 1781. Two companies were to be disposed and stationed in 
Lincoln Co., and the third at the port of Falmouth. It was 
also resolved that two armed sloops, to mount not less than 
10 nor more than 14 four or six pounders, should be procured, 
by hire or purchase, to serve as Guarda Costas. A later re- 
solve, viz., iNIay 19, 1781, authorized the governor to order 
out one or more companies of the local militia to serve for the 
immediate defence of the parts adjacent to Penobscot sound, 
and provision was made for raising in Lincoln Co, an addi- 
tional company of 70 men, to be stationed where their services 
should be most needed from time td time, and who should l)e 
enlisted to serve for twelve months from May 1, 1781. 

Another call to provide troops for service at Rhode Island 
was made by a resolve dated June 15, 1781, directing that 
500 men be detached from the militia of various counties, to 
serve for the term of five months. A fine of Â£15 for each man 
deficient was laid upon every town that should neglect to fur- 
nish, within ten days, its proportion of men required under 
this resolve, the fines to 1)e included in the next state tax. 



XXXVlll INTRODUCTION. 



A detachment of the militia to serve as a temporary rein- 
forcement to the continental army, at West Point or else- 
where, was provided for by a resolve passed June 30, 1781, 
which directed the governor to issue orders to the brigadiers 
of the various counties to detach from their brigades the 
number of men apportioned to them by schedule, the men so 
detached to serve for tliree months. The num])er called for 
by the resolve was 2,700 and the governor was authorized 
to form them into four regiments of eight companies each. 
Towns failing to furnish their proportion by July 10, 1781, 
were to be subject to a fine of Â£20 for each man deficient, the 
same to be assessed upon them in the next state tax ordered. 
The hire or bounty paid by any town to secure men was to be 
credited to them, however, in the same tax. 

Another call, which proved the last one necessary to sup- 
ply the deficienc}^ of the Massachusetts line of the continental 
arm}^ was made l)y a resolve passed March 8, 1782, wherein 
it was directed that 1,500 men be raised to serve for three 
years or during the war, under the usual provisions applying 
to continental enlistments. The assessors, however, of each 
town and plantation were directed to class the inhabitants, 
and every other person liable to pay taxes, in their respective 
towns, into as many classes as there were men to l)e raised by 
the town, "intermixing the poor with the Rich, so as to make 
the Taxable property and Polls in each Class as nearly equal 
as may be ; " and each person in a class was to contribute 
toward the hire of a man by the class, in the exact proportion 
such person was assessed in the previous state tax. Addi- 
tional resolves respecting this call for 1,500 men were passed 
on April 2C) and June 27, 1782, owing to the fact that it was 
not promptly resjionded to, many towns 1)eing delin(iuent in 
furnishing their proportion of men called for, and tlie time was 
extended for complying with its requirements until rTuly 15, 
1782 ; but no further call for troops for continental service 
ap})ears to have l)een necessary, â€” at least, no more appear 
among the records up to the declaration of peace. 

A resolve providing for seacoast defence was passed July G, 
1782, when various small detachments of artillery, to be sta- 
tioned at Falmouth, Cape Eliza])eth, Phim Island, Gloucester, 
Beverly, Salem, Mailtlclicad, Dartmouth and Plymouth, were 



IXTRODUCTION. XXxix 



authorized to be raised and to be maintained as Ions: as the 
governor, witli advice of council, should deem necessary for 
the advantage and safety of the Commonwealth. 

A communication from General AVashington, pointing out the 
possible danger of an attack upon Boston, caused the General 
Court to pass a resolve on Sept. 20, 1782, requesting the 
governor to issue orders to the militia of certain of the coun- 
ties to hold themselves in readiness to march at a minute's 
warning to such- places as might be designated, and also desir- 
ing him to see that the forts and garrisons in and al)out the 
harbor of Boston should he properly strengthened and manned. 
He was also authorized, if necessary, to order any of the 
militia to march to anv of the neiofhborinor states and there do 
duty for a term not exceeding one month. 

At various times throughout the war the council, and the 
governor as well, drafted or detached portions of the militia to 
serve for short periods for local defence or at Rhode Island on 
alarms, but the acts and resolves herein enumerated cover all 
the really important measures taken to raise or enlist men.

Note. â€” All names are given exactly as they appear on the original records. The order of 
arrangement of the facts of service in each individual record given is the same, as nearly as pos- 
sible, as the original entries, and is as follows: The name; the place of residence, if given; the 
rank; the kind of document whereon the record appears; the enlistment and discharge, if 
given; the time of service; remarks. 

A discrepancy will sometimes be noted between the service given and the actual service as 
figured between the dates of enlistment and discharge. The difference is accounted for by the 
practice of including, with service performed, a time allowance for travel on the basis of one 
day for every 20 miles out or home. As the same name may appear under various forms, each 
carrying some portion of a record of service, it is necessary in order to obtain the complete 
record, as far as preserved, of any given individual, to examine all the forms under which 
B name is stated to appear in the Record Index.
